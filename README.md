# Greeter
## About the Project
A simple greeter program that greets you and tells you what day it is.
## How to Use
The program can be initialised using any Python interpreter. Enter your name in the input field and press Enter. A string will print greeting you by name and telling you what the day is.
## How it Works
The datetime Python library is imported so the datetime functions can be used. The getDate variable stores the date that's recognised as today's date by the computer. The day variable gets the name of the day from the getDate variable. The username varaible holds the user input when prompted to enter a name. 

After pressing Enter, one of seven strings will be printed depending on the value of the day variable.
